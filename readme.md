## My process

I like to write first the HTML, only the HTML, it looks weird but when it's
done I have a better idea of the styles needed.

Then I try to use only CSS for everything (animations, states, styles) and the
last step is to add JS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS / CSS
- javascript


### What I learned

1. neuomorphism design.
2. change html document using javascript.
